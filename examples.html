<h2>Functional Programming why?</h2>
<p>The beauty of Scala is you don't have to use functional programming all the time. You can choose to just use it in situations where it's advantageous. You will find that as you get more familiar with Scala you'll use more functional programming techniques as the code tends to be clearer and shorter than the equivalent non-functional code.</p>
<p>For instance Quicksort in Java:</p>

public void quicksort(int array[]) {
quicksort(array, 0, array.length - 1);              
}

public void quicksort(int array[], int start, int end){
        int i = start;                          
        int k = end;                            

        if (end - start >= 1){
                int pivot = array[start];       
                while (k > i){
                        while (array[i] <= pivot && i <= end && k > i) i++;                                    
                        while (array[k] > pivot && k >= start && k >= i) k--;                                        
                        if (k > i) swap(array, i, k);                      
                }
                swap(array, start, k);                        
                quickSort(array, start, k - 1); 
                quickSort(array, k + 1, end);   
        }else{
                return;                     
        }
}

public void swap(int array[], int index1, int index2) {
int temp = array[index1];           
array[index1] = array[index2];      
array[index2] = temp;               
}

<p>and now in Scala:</p>

    def quicksort(a:Array[Int]): Array[Int] =
        if (a.length < 2) a

        else {
            val pivot = a(a.length / 2)
            sort (a filter (pivot > _)) ++ (a filter (pivot == _)) ++ sort (a filter(pivot < _))
        }

<p>The Scala version is shorter, more readable, and much closer to how you'd describe the process in words, vs. the Java which is much more about the mechanics of doing it.</p>

<h2>Syntax</h2>
<p>Scala is much, much more terse than Java. At first glance, a Java developer can be a bit bewildered, as they're used to having so much laid out for them. When you start writing Scala you'll probably want to stick to what you know and keep doing that (with the few, minor changes such as the order you declare things changed) - and Scala is perfectly happy for you to do that. Within a matter of days you'll find that you get used to not having to do all that extra typing, and actually feel weighed down by it when you switch back to Java code.</p>
<p>So here is the same quick sort example written in Scala but using Java like syntax that Java Developer learning Scala might write.

def quickSort(array:Array[Int]):Unit ={
	quickSort(array, 0, array.length - 1);
}


def quickSort(array:Array[Int], start:Int, end:Int):Unit = {
        var i:Int = start;
        var k:Int = end;

        if (end - start >= 1){
                val pivot = array(start);
                while (k > i){
                        while (array(i) <= pivot && i <= end && k > i) i += 1;
                        while (array(k) > pivot && k >= start && k >= i) k -= 1;
                        if (k > i) swap(array, i, k);
                }
                swap(array, start, k);
                quickSort(array, start, k - 1);
                quickSort(array, k + 1, end);
        }else{
                return;
        }
}

def swap(array:Array[Int], index1:Int, index2:Int):Unit = {
	var temp:Int = array(index1);
	array(index1) = array(index2);
	array(index2) = temp;
}

<h2>Examples and tutorials</h2>
<p>Java tutorials, textbooks, and forums are 10 a penny. Scala has fewer resources, but they are of a very high quality, the community is strong and enthusiastic, and unlike in Java you're likely to be able to get answers to any tricky questions directly from those implementing the language itself.</p>
<p>Stack Overflow is very active <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/tags/scala/info">Stack Overflow's Scala Tutorial</a></p>
<p>Twitter has opened sourced Scala training material <a href="http://twitter.github.com/scala_school/">Twitter's Scala School</a></p>

<h2>IDE/tool support</h2>
<p>IntelliJ and Eclipse both have widely used Scala plugins, as do more unusual environments such as VIM and Emacs. You can keep using many of your supporting Java tools - Java Application servers, dependency management all work with Scala, plus you have new options such as the REPL for interactive Scala sessions (which can run in the context of your project) and external compilation daemons which accelerate experimentation, development and learning in ways that are all but impossible with Java.</p>

                        <p>We were Java engineers, but we adopted Scala to deliver applications more quickly and at lower cost. Scala code on average is about 3 times shorter than the equivalent Java, without losing performance or scalability.</p>

<p>If you develop in Java then you will feel immediately at home with Scala. You can use the same libraries and IDE, the way you package jars and wars is the same and your runtime environment is also the same.</p>

                        <p>Scala beats Java on runtime, and it had a smaller code size and a smaller memory footprint. "Scala['s] concise notation and powerful language features allowed for the best optimization of code complexity,".</p>
